Hazelnut Coolattas vs. Addiction

Checking this add 

You never really get over addiction, 
you simply replace one with another that’s hopefully less harmful.
Like quitting smoking, but developing a habit for chewing on toothpicks. 
Or switching from calling, 
then hanging up on your ex-girlfriend in the middle of the night,
to writing long, sloppy love letters to Jennifer Lopez.
And then suddenly it’s 3 o’clock in the morning,
and you’re searching the internet for cheap airfare to LAX
when you come across Miss Lopez’s web site
So you start bombarding her with email that she never answers.
Which really pisses you off, 
so you send her a virus disguised as a love poem
which somehow gets sent out to all the computers everywhere
and since everyone wants someone to send them a love poem they open it 
and Corporate America suddenly shuts down because addiction has this snowball effect.

For me, it started with Hershey Bars while I was getting sober.
My body had been processing drugs and alcohol into sugar for so long 
that I was craving sweets.
I tried cookies and ice cream, even donuts- 
and I hate donuts!
But it was donuts that led me to the greatest sugar rush known to mankind,
a large Hazelnut Coffee Coolatta, 
from Dunkin’ Donuts.
Icy cold, caffeine mixed with sugar like a legal speedball,
Yes, I want whipped cream on top of that!
Damn the calories, 
damn the fat content!
Dunkin’ Donuts is the best connection I’ve ever had, 
there’s one on every corner and they’re open 24 hours a day!

So I’m leaving this poetry reading one night,
all hot and sweaty,
when I start jonesin’ bad.
But it’s cool ‘cause I know how to handle this,
and there’s a Dunkin’ Donuts right up the street.
But when I get there... 
it’s closed!

You can drive through any of the little bitty, no name towns around here
 at 4 o’clock in the morning and find a Dunkin’ Donuts, 
open for business, stocked with pink frosted pastries, steaming coffee,
and yes, Coolattas!
But in the middle of Cambridge, 
where people are walking around with pink frosted hair
and there’s a police station two blocks away,
they close at 11 o’clock! 

I’m trying to remember where I’d seen another one.
I’m stumbling around downtown clutching a handful of dollar bills 
like a junkie looking for a fix!
Hop into my car chain smoking cigarettes 
all the way to the one by my house, 
and...
It’s closed for repairs!

Well I’m freaking out now
because there’s a bar right next door
and I’m about 3 steps shy of 12
and a beer sounds really good.
I mean fuck a Coolatta, 
It’s not like I didn’t try!

I’m standing there fumbling for my lighter
when my father’s 2-year AA medallion falls out of my pocket,
clinks on the asphalt parking lot,
shines in the pink and white light frosting this New England night,

One Day At A Time.

That’s how you fight addiction, 
you never get over it.
But toothpicks cost like thirty-nine cents a box,
Jennifer Lopez can always use some more love letters,
and there’s another Dunkin’ Donuts right down the road,
so just keep driving man.
Just keep driving.
